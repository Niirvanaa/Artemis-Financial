# Artemis-Financial

I’m submitting the Artemis Financial Practices for Secure Software Report as my artifact for this course.
About the Client
Artemis Financial is a company that handles sensitive client financial data, so having secure software is a must. They asked me to look at their application and figure out where it might be vulnerable, and then make improvements to make it safer for users. Basically, they wanted to make sure their software wasn’t leaving them open to hacks or data breaches.
Reflection on My Work
When I went through the software, I focused on spotting vulnerabilities like weak authentication, poor input validation, and potential data exposure. I think I did well in following secure coding practices and making changes that really reduce risk. Coding securely matters because one small hole in the software could cause serious issues for the company—financial loss, legal problems, or even just losing trust with clients. By improving security, I feel like I helped Artemis protect their customers and their reputation.
Challenges and Takeaways
The trickiest part was working with parts of the code that didn’t have much documentation. It took some digging to figure out how it worked and where the risks were. On the other hand, going through the OWASP top 10 vulnerabilities was super helpful because it gave me a clear checklist to follow.
How I Increased Security
I added multiple layers of security: better input validation, encryption for sensitive data, and stronger authentication practices. I also made sure to refactor code carefully so it stayed functional. In the future, I’d probably rely more on automated tools like static code analyzers and dependency scanners to find vulnerabilities faster and figure out the best fixes.
Ensuring Functionality and Security
After refactoring, I tested everything to make sure nothing broke and no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Running unit tests, integration tests, and using tools like OWASP Dependency Check helped me feel confident the code was secure and still worked as expected.
Tools and Practices I Found Useful
Some tools and practices that I know I’ll use again:
OWASP Dependency Check to catch vulnerable libraries
Secure coding techniques like proper authentication, input validation, and encryption
Static analysis tools to spot hidden issues before they become problems
What I Can Show Employers
From this assignment, I can show that I can:
Find and fix software vulnerabilities
Apply secure coding practices in real-world scenarios
Refactor code safely without breaking functionality
Use tools and processes that make software more secure
Overall, this project gave me real hands-on experience in keeping software secure while making sure it still works, which I think is a skill employers would value.
